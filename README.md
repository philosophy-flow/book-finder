This project uses the Google Books API to retrieve information related to the user's input. Title information, author information, a picture of the book, a snippet of the book's description, and a link to more information is displayed.

Flexbox was used to position the result cards, and CSS grid was used to position the content within each card. The fetch API was used to make requests.
